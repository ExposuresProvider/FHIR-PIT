## README ##

The /data/input/other directory contains sample environmental exposure files. The files contain example environmental exposures data of various types, e.g., US EPA CMAQ airborne pollutant exposures. All of the environmental exposures data were retrieved from public sources and thus carry no licensing or usage restrictions.

For more information on the types of environmental exposures and their original sources, please see https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Translator-All/wiki/ICEES.

The purpose of including the subdirectories and files contained within the /data/input/other directory is to provide sample data for users who wish to build and run FHIR PIT using sample data.
