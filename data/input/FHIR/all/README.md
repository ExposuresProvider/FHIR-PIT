## README ##

The /data/input/FHIR/all directory contains sample FHIR files. The files do not contain real patient data, but rather dummy data. Any apparent identifies, dates of service, etc. are arbitrary and not associated with a real patient record.

The sample FHIR files were made openly available by HL7 FHIR and thus carry no licensing or usage restrictions. For more information, please see https://build.fhir.org/index.html.

The sole purpose of including the subdirectories and files contained within the /data/input/FHIR/all directory is to provide sample data for users who wish to build and run FHIR PIT using sample data.
