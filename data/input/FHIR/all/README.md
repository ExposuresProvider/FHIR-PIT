## README ##

The /FHIR/all directory contains sample FHIR files. The files do not contain real patient data, but rather dummy data. Any apparent identifies, dates of service, etc. are arbitrary and not associated with a real patient record.

The sole purpose of including the subdirectories and files contained within the /FHIR/all directory is to provide sample data for users who wish to download and demo FHIR PIT.
